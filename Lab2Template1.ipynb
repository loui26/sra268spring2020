        "Though I was unable to get the spine function to work in tablaeu, The graph would have consisted of a single varible with a scale of magnatude on the x-axis. Then, each mascot class would be represented in the spine. The single varible that determined the spine would be winning points, with 1200 being the deciding integer. Then there would have been a scale on the bottom that would have mapped out mascots that were less than 1200 and then the scale would continue past 1200. The spine would also be color coded To allow the viewer to see which mascot class had the largest difference from the other classes. From this I learned that it is one thing to think about how a graph may look, and it is yet another to actually make that visualastion a graph in tablaeu. "

The order with the most amount of points during the year 2000 was, the carnivores. This could suggest that schools with carnivores for their mascots earn the most points.
